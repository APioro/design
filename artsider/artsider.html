                The Artsider Foundation, based in Kraków, is dedicated to increasing the visibility of artists living with schizophrenia. 
                Its mission is to replace stigma with dialogue, showing that art created in the context of mental health challenges 
                has the same power to move, inspire, and connect people. The foundation needed a visual identity that reflects these values: inclusivity, optimism, and authenticity — something that speaks both to the warmth of the community and the individual vision of each artist.
                While their works often appear on mugs in cafés, Artsider’s impact goes much further: it is about creating a cultural space where creativity is seen as universal and diversity becomes a source of beauty and strength.

                The foundation needed a branding system that reflected inclusivity, optimism, and authenticity. The previous identity was unclear and inconsistent, lacking warmth and energy that represented the foundation’s mission. The challenge was to create a visual language that respected the seriousness of their work while radiating the joy and creativity of the artists they support.

                The logo combines a circle symbolizing openness and community with a bold, offset mark that conveys authenticity and uniqueness. A friendly, organic type system balances readability with a human touch. The refreshed color palette keeps the recognizable turquoise and orange while introducing yellow and pastel pink to add lightness and optimism. Supporting patterns, inspired by recurring motifs in the artists’ works — spirals, eyes, butterflies — add depth and flexibility to the identity. Together, these elements create a system that is professional yet approachable, ready to be applied across digital and print materials, campaigns, and everyday touchpoints like mugs.
